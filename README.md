# Audyn
Audyn is a decentralized peer-to-peer music app built with Flutter. It lets users stream and share local or downloaded music via a secure torrent-based system. Using MusicBrainz metadata, it organizes tracks, tracks play counts, and supports future smart playlistsâ€”all focused on privacy and decentralization.
